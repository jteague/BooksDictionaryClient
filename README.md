# Books Collection Client

This project is the client for the [Books Dictionary Server](https://github.com/jteague/BooksDictionaryServer). This is my first React project to get my hands dirty.

This frontend displays a list of books and makes REST calls.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
